# Objective
Using the CRISP DM process to execute a Data Science project plan. 
Specific questions that needs to be asked by each stage so I can execute my project effectively.

1. Business Understanding:
   - What is the main objective of the project?
   - Who are the stakeholders involved in this project?
   - What are their expectations or requirements?
   - Are there any business constraints or limitations?
   - How will the results of this project be used to support business decisions?

2. Data Understanding:
   - What data sources are available for this project?
   - What is the quality of the data (completeness, accuracy, consistency)?
   - Are there any legal or ethical considerations in using the data?
   - What features are relevant to the project's objective?
   - Do the data sources require any preprocessing or cleaning?

3. Data Preparation:
   - What data cleaning steps are necessary (e.g., handling missing values, outlier detection)?
   - How will the data be transformed or aggregated for analysis?
   - What feature engineering or selection techniques will be used?
   - How will the data be split into training, validation, and testing sets?
   - Are there any additional data sources needed to enrich the dataset?

4. Modeling:
   - What machine learning algorithms or statistical techniques are suitable for this project?
   - How will model performance be evaluated (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)?
   - Are there any hyperparameters that need to be tuned?
   - What model validation techniques will be used (e.g., cross-validation, holdout method)?
   - How will the final model be selected?

5. Evaluation:
   - How does the model perform on the validation and testing sets?
   - Are the results aligned with the business objectives and stakeholder expectations?
   - Are there any biases or fairness concerns with the model's predictions?
   - How can the model's performance be further improved?
   - What are the key insights or findings from the analysis?

6. Deployment:
   - How will the model be deployed into a production environment?
   - What infrastructure and resources are needed to support the deployment?
   - How will the model be monitored and maintained over time?
   - What is the plan for updating the model as new data becomes available?
   - How will the results be communicated to stakeholders and integrated into business processes?

By answering these questions during each stage of the CRISP-DM process, you will have a comprehensive project plan that can be effectively executed.
